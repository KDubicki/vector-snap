# 13. Export Formats

Besides SVG (produced in the browser from the edited document, see
[08-svg-editor.md](08-svg-editor.md#export-)), VectorSnap converts documents to formats
for 3D printing, cutting and print. Conversion runs on the **backend**, so other clients
of the microservice can use it too.

| Format | Endpoint | Typical use | Status |
|--------|----------|-------------|--------|
| SVG | — (browser) | Web, design tools | ✅ |
| STL | `POST /api/v1/export/stl` | 3D printing (relief / multi-color prints) | ✅ |
| DXF | `POST /api/v1/export/dxf` | Laser cutters, vinyl plotters, CNC | ✅ |
| PDF | `POST /api/v1/export/pdf` | Print, documents | ✅ |

All endpoints take `multipart/form-data` with an `svg` file in the
[SVG output contract](05-api-specification.md#svg-output-contract) plus format options,
and return the file as an attachment. Invalid SVG → `422 INVALID_SVG`.

## Shared geometry (`app/services/svg_geometry.py`)

1. **Parse** the contract with lxml (no entity resolution, no network, no huge trees).
   Groups (`<g data-palette-index fill>`) become layers bottom to top; paths keep their
   own `fill` if set.
2. **Path data** is read with svgelements — all SVG commands, absolute and relative
   (the editor writes Paper.js path data such as `h`, `v`, `c`).
3. **Flatten** curves to polylines where a format needs polygons: quadratic and cubic
   Béziers are evaluated vectorized with NumPy; the number of samples comes from the
   control-polygon length (an upper bound of the arc length) and a tolerance of
   0.25 px. Arcs are converted to cubic curves first.
4. **Polygons** are built with Shapely using even-odd semantics (rings inside rings are
   holes), which matches how the tracer encodes holes.

## STL

```bash
curl -F svg=@logo.svg -F width_mm=120 -F base_mm=1.5 -F layer_mm=0.8 \
     http://localhost:8000/api/v1/export/stl -o logo.stl
```

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `width_mm` | `100` | Model width; height follows the aspect ratio |
| `base_mm` | `1.0` | Base plate under all shapes (`0` = no base) |
| `layer_mm` | `1.0` | Extrusion height per color layer |
| `layered` | `true` | `true`: layer *n* (bottom to top) is *n × layer_mm* high (relief, easy color changes by height); `false`: all layers share one height |
| `layer_heights` | `{}` | JSON object `{"<paletteIndex>": mm}` overriding the height above the base per color (0 < h ≤ 100); **`0` leaves a color out** (e.g. print a logo without its background). Colors not listed follow `layer_mm` / `layered` |
| `mirror` | `false` | Mirror horizontally — for stamps or printing the top face down on the bed |

Model construction:

- Coordinates are scaled to millimetres and the **y axis is flipped** (SVG y points
  down; without the flip the print would be mirrored).
- Shapes of one layer are united, so adjacent pieces (e.g. after splitting in the
  editor) do not produce internal walls; outlines are simplified with a 0.05 px
  tolerance to drop the many collinear points of straight edges traced as curves.
- Each polygon becomes a **closed prism**: caps from GEOS **constrained Delaunay**
  triangulation (`shapely.constrained_delaunay_triangles`, robust for polygons with
  dozens of holes) and walls from every ring edge. Caps and walls share the exact ring
  vertices, so every body is watertight with outward normals.
- The base plate is the union of the **included** layers, so transparent areas,
  deleted shapes and colors left out with height 0 stay open. Leaving out every color is
  `422 INVALID_PARAMETERS`.
- The model is built as **bodies** (base plate, one per color) — the STL contains them
  all; the same bodies feed other 3D formats.
- Output is binary STL (`model/stl`), units mm.

Tests check real mesh properties, not just the file: every body is **closed** (each
edge shared by exactly two triangles in opposite directions — for touching bodies:
balanced directed edges), the **signed volume equals area × height** (which also proves
outward normals), dimensions in mm and layer heights. Performance: a 440-shape document
exports in ≈1.5 s (≈177 k triangles, 8.8 MB).

## DXF

```bash
curl -F svg=@logo.svg -F width_mm=300 -F fill=false \
     http://localhost:8000/api/v1/export/dxf -o logo.dxf
```

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `width_mm` | `100` | Drawing width; height follows the aspect ratio |
| `fill` | `false` | Also add a solid `HATCH` per polygon (holes as inner boundaries) — for previews or engraving; cutters usually only need outlines |

- DXF R2010 written with [ezdxf](https://ezdxf.mozman.at/), `$INSUNITS = 4`
  (millimetres), metric measurement.
- **One DXF layer per color group** (`color-<paletteIndex>`) with its true color, so
  cutter software can assign power/speed or tools per color.
- Every polygon becomes **closed `LWPOLYLINE`s** — the outline plus one per hole.
- Shapes of one color are united first (same geometry pipeline as STL), so pieces split
  in the editor do not produce double cuts along their shared edge; same mm scaling and
  y flip as STL.
- Tests read the file back with ezdxf (layers, colors, closed outlines, extent in mm,
  hatch boundaries) and require a clean **ezdxf audit** (no errors, no fixes).

## PDF

```bash
curl -F svg=@logo.svg -F page=a4 -F margin_mm=15 \
     http://localhost:8000/api/v1/export/pdf -o logo.pdf
```

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `page` | `fit` | `fit`: the page is the drawing plus margins; `a4` / `letter`: standard page, orientation chosen from the drawing's aspect ratio, drawing scaled to fit inside the margins and centered |
| `width_mm` | `100` | Drawing width for `page=fit` |
| `margin_mm` | `10` | Margin on every side |

- Written with [ReportLab](https://www.reportlab.com/); one page, compressed streams,
  title/creator metadata.
- **Curves stay curves**: no flattening — every path segment becomes a native PDF path
  operator (cubic Bézier → `c`; quadratic curves are converted exactly to cubic; arcs via
  cubic approximation), so the output is resolution-independent and small (a 440-shape
  document: 0.24 MB in 0.18 s).
- Each shape is filled in its own color with the **nonzero** rule, like SVG, so holes
  render the same as in the browser.
- Tests render the PDF with pdfium and check pixel colors (shape, hole, background),
  page size and centering, and inspect path segments to make sure Béziers are kept.

## Frontend

For STL the panel also lists every color with an *include* checkbox and a height field
(empty = automatic, shown as placeholder); this becomes `layer_heights`. Leaving out
every color disables the export with an explanation.

The result step has an **Export to other formats** panel: choose STL, DXF or PDF, adjust
its options (number, checkbox and choice options, validated in the browser with the same
ranges as the API; each format remembers its own values) and download the file named
after the uploaded image (`logo.png` → `logo.stl`). The export always uses
the **edited** document. Formats are declared in `src/lib/exportFormats.ts`.
